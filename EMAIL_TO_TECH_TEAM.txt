Subject: CallRail Setup Required for Dr. Brent Landing Pages - Phone Number Pools & Google Ads Integration

Hi Tech Team,

We have two new call-only landing pages that are ready to go live and need CallRail integration set up. These pages are mobile-optimized and designed specifically for phone call conversions.

LANDING PAGES READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:

1. Beverly Hills Landing Page
   - URL: https://dr-brent-call-lps-1.vercel.app/
   - Repository: shoutgeorge1/dr-brent-call-lps-1
   - Phone Number: (310) 919-1060
   - Location: Beverly Hills, CA

2. Santa Barbara Landing Page
   - URL: https://dr-brent-call-lps-sb.vercel.app/
   - Repository: shoutgeorge1/dr-brent-call-lps-sb
   - Phone Number: (805) 979-2535
   - Location: Santa Barbara, CA

CALLRAIL SETUP REQUIREMENTS:

1. Direct Call Numbers
   We need direct call numbers set up in CallRail for both landing pages:
   - Beverly Hills: A tracking number that forwards to (310) 919-1060
   - Santa Barbara: A tracking number that forwards to (805) 979-2535

2. Website Pools
   We need website pools configured in CallRail for both landing pages to enable Dynamic Number Insertion (DNI). This will allow us to:
   - Track which landing page generated the call
   - Attribute calls to specific marketing campaigns
   - Feed conversion data back to Google Ads for higher quality lead tracking

3. JavaScript Code Implementation
   Both landing pages have placeholder comments where the CallRail DNI script needs to be added. The script should be inserted just before the closing </body> tag.
   
   Location in code:
   - Look for: <!-- CallRail Dynamic Number Insertion -->
   - Replace the empty script tag with the CallRail swap.js URL
   
   Beverly Hills file: index.html (line ~1149)
   Santa Barbara file: index.html (line ~1149)

4. Google Ads Integration
   We need the CallRail integration configured to send call conversion data back to Google Ads. This will help us:
   - Track call conversions in Google Ads
   - Optimize campaigns based on call quality
   - Improve lead quality scoring

CALLRAIL ACCOUNT INFORMATION:
- We have two accounts set up in CallRail under the main account
- If you need me to set this up, I'm happy to work with you on it
- Please let me know if you need access credentials or account details

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- All phone numbers are plain text in the DOM (not in images) - CallRail can swap them automatically
- Phone numbers appear in: header, hero section, procedure cards, and footer
- Both pages are mobile-optimized and responsive
- UTM parameter tracking is already implemented

NEXT STEPS:
1. Set up direct call numbers in CallRail for both locations
2. Configure website pools for Dynamic Number Insertion
3. Provide the CallRail swap.js script URLs for both landing pages
4. I'll add the JavaScript code to both repositories and push the updates
5. Configure Google Ads integration for call conversion tracking

Please let me know:
- If you can handle the CallRail setup, or if you need me to do it
- The CallRail swap.js script URLs once the pools are configured
- Any questions or additional information needed

Thanks!
